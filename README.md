Timing converter for microwave recipes

Hello! This is my first PWA. I wanted to make something simple that didn’t need me to learn new JS libraries, yet functional so I’d actually use it myself. So I made this. 

Mīcrowävé converts timings for a microwave recipe designed for one wattage of microwave to timings for a microwave with a different wattage. No ads, no cookies (unless Replit decides otherwise), just as we like it.
